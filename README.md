# basic_neural_networks
This repository, is for demonstrating how various libraries can be used for building neural networks.

## Files and their contents
1. neural_nw_with_numpy.ipynb
 - This file contains the demonstration of how a 3-layer neural network can be made from scratch using nothing but numpy, for a non-linear regression problem.
2. neural_network_with_pytorch.ipynb
 - This file contains the demonstration of different ways neural networks can be made for a non linear regression problem using Pytorch. Below are the list of demonstrations.
   - From Scratch without using much of the functionalities provided by PyTorch
   - Layers and model from scratch but using the auto differential features provided by PyTorch
   - By using optimizers and making the layer's class inherit the nn.Module in the implementation
   - Using PyTorch's Builtin functionalities such as optimizers, layers and the Sequential API
   - Using PyTorch's Builtin functionalities such as optimizers, layers and without the Sequential API
